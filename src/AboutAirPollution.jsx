          PM stands for Particulate Matter, which is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets in the air. Particles are defined by their diameter for air quality regulatory
          purposes. Those with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10) are inhalable into the lungs and can induce adverse health effects. Fine particulate matter is defined as
          particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5).

          O3 (Ozone) is a gas molecule composed of three oxygen atoms. Ozone is good up high, bad nearby. The ozone layer found high in the upper atmosphere shields us from much of
          the sun's ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone air pollution at ground level where we can breathe it causes serious health problems. Ozone aggressively attacks lung
          tissue by reacting chemically with it.

          NO and NO2 are two kinds of gases and are referred as NOx (Nitrogen Oxides). NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide) at high concentrations causes inflammation of the airways. Breathing
          in high levels of NO2 can increase the likelihood of respiratory problems: wheezing, coughing, colds, flu and bronchitis. People with asthma are prone to have more
          intense attacks. Prolonged exposure to high levels of NO2 can cause irreversible damages to the respiratory system.

          Birch trees are trees with beige, silvery or white bark that is often flaky. They are part of the order Fagales and the family Betulaceae of trees. Birch pollen allergy
          is one of the most common seasonal allergies. Between 8-16% of people are sensitized to the allergen. The birch pollen count will typically be highest in the morning. But
          as you go throughout your day, the pollen may collect on your clothes, skin and hair. You then breathe it in as you go about your day or when you sleep at night.

          particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. AQI runs from 0 to 500 where a lower score indicates cleaner air and a higher score denotes
          poorer air condition.
